    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I created this Mexican ground beef casserole when I wanted something different 
        that I could make ahead if I wanted to. Double the recipe for company! 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salter butter</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package cornbread stuffing mix (such as Kraft® Stove Top®) </li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with jalapeno </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef 
            and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
        </li>

        <li>
            While the beef is cooking, make stuffing. Bring water and butter to a boil in a 
            medium saucepan. Stir in stuffing mix; cover. Remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce into the beef mixture. Simmer for 2 minutes. 
            Add corn and Cheddar cheese. Simmer until cheese is melted completely, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to 
            a casserole dish. Spread cornbread stuffing evenly over the top.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
